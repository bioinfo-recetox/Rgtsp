# Rgtsp

Extends Geman's Top Scoring Pairs method by implementing different 
scoring functions and multi-class decision rules (using trees). This 
is a parallelized implementation of the algorithm based on OpenMP.

*Note:* Currently, this code works with GNU C/C++ compiler (and similar)
and relies on -fopenmp compiling/linking option.
